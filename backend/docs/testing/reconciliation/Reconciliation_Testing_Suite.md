# Comprehensive Reconciliation Testing Suite

This document provides a complete testing framework for the financial reconciliation system, including sample data files, AI prompts, and expected results.

## Sample Data Files Overview

### 1. Basic Bank Reconciliation Files
**Files:** `recon_file_a.csv` and `recon_file_b.csv`
- **Purpose:** Test basic reconciliation with different date formats, amount formats, and status values
- **Records:** 20 transactions with 2 unmatched in file B
- **Key Features:** Currency extraction, date conversion, status mapping, tolerance matching

### 2. Credit Card & Expense Files
**Files:** `credit_card_transactions.csv` and `expense_receipts.csv`
- **Purpose:** Test expense reconciliation with negative amounts and fuzzy matching
- **Records:** 15 credit card transactions, 17 expense receipts (includes unmatched)
- **Key Features:** Negative amount handling, merchant name variations, category mapping

### 3. Invoice & Payment Files
**Files:** `invoice_register.csv` and `payment_records.csv`
- **Purpose:** Test accounts payable reconciliation with complex business rules
- **Records:** 12 invoices, 13 payments (includes unmatched and cancelled)
- **Key Features:** Net amount calculations, vendor matching, status filtering

## Quick Start Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Bank Statement Reconciliation
**Files:** `recon_file_a.csv` + `recon_file_b.csv`
**AI Prompt:**
```
Reconcile bank statements with internal records. Match by reference number exactly and amounts with $0.01 tolerance. Extract amounts from text format in file A. Only include settled/completed transactions. Convert dates from DD/MM/YYYY to YYYY-MM-DD format.
```
**Expected Results:** 20 matches, 2 unmatched from file B

### Scenario 2: Employee Expense Matching
**Files:** `credit_card_transactions.csv` + `expense_receipts.csv`
**AI Prompt:**
```
Match credit card charges with expense receipts. Match amounts exactly (handle negative values). Match dates with format conversion. Fuzzy match merchant names to handle variations. Only include posted transactions and approved receipts.
```
**Expected Results:** 13-14 matches, some unmatched due to pending/rejected status

### Scenario 3: Vendor Payment Processing
**Files:** `invoice_register.csv` + `payment_records.csv`
**AI Prompt:**
```
Reconcile invoices with payments using invoice numbers and vendor codes. Match net amounts with $1.00 tolerance. Only include approved invoices and processed payments. Exclude cancelled invoices from reconciliation.
```
**Expected Results:** 9-10 matches (excluding cancelled and pending items)

## Detailed Testing Instructions

### 1. File Upload and Selection
1. Navigate to the reconciliation interface
2. Upload both files for your chosen scenario
3. Verify file preview shows correct data structure
4. Select both files for reconciliation

### 2. AI Configuration Testing
1. Choose "AI Configuration" option
2. Enter one of the provided AI prompts
3. Click "Generate Configuration"
4. Review the generated rules for accuracy
5. Apply the configuration to proceed

### 3. Manual Configuration Testing
1. Choose "Start Fresh Manually" option
2. Configure extraction rules to clean data
3. Set up filter rules to exclude unwanted records
4. Define reconciliation rules for matching
5. Select relevant columns for output

### 4. Results Validation
1. Review match statistics and percentages
2. Examine matched records for accuracy
3. Validate unmatched records are legitimate
4. Check that business rules were applied correctly
5. Export results for further analysis

## Advanced Testing Scenarios

### Multi-Rule Complexity Test
**Objective:** Test multiple reconciliation rules working together
**Configuration:**
- Match by reference number (exact)
- Match by amount (tolerance $0.01)
- Match by account number (exact)
- Match by customer ID (exact)

### Data Quality Testing
**Objective:** Test system handling of imperfect data
**Test Cases:**
- Missing reference numbers
- Invalid date formats
- Inconsistent amount formats
- Special characters in text fields
- Duplicate transaction IDs

### Performance Testing
**Objective:** Test system performance with larger datasets
**Method:**
- Use existing files as templates
- Generate larger datasets (1000+ records)
- Measure processing time
- Monitor memory usage
- Validate result accuracy remains high

## Expected Performance Benchmarks

### Processing Time Targets
- **Small datasets (< 100 records):** < 2 seconds
- **Medium datasets (100-1000 records):** < 10 seconds
- **Large datasets (1000+ records):** < 60 seconds

### Accuracy Targets
- **Perfect matches:** 95% accuracy rate
- **Tolerance matches:** 90% accuracy rate
- **False positives:** < 5%
- **False negatives:** < 10%

### System Resource Limits
- **Memory usage:** < 500MB for datasets up to 10,000 records
- **CPU usage:** < 80% during processing
- **Concurrent users:** Support 5+ simultaneous reconciliations

## Error Testing Scenarios

### Invalid Configuration Testing
1. **Missing Required Fields:** Submit configuration without reconciliation rules
2. **Invalid Column References:** Reference non-existent columns
3. **Conflicting Rules:** Set up contradictory filter conditions
4. **Invalid Tolerance Values:** Use negative or extremely large tolerances

### Data Validation Testing
1. **Empty Files:** Upload files with headers only
2. **Mismatched Schemas:** Use files with completely different structures
3. **Invalid Data Types:** Include text in numeric fields
4. **Encoding Issues:** Test with special characters and different encodings

### Edge Case Testing
1. **Identical Records:** Files with duplicate transactions
2. **No Matches Possible:** Files from different time periods
3. **All Records Match:** Perfect alignment between files
4. **Extreme Values:** Very large numbers, negative amounts, zero values

## Test Data Maintenance

### Adding New Test Files
1. Create CSV files with realistic business data
2. Include various data quality issues
3. Document expected match counts
4. Update this testing guide

### Test File Standards
- **Naming Convention:** `[business_scenario]_[file_role].csv`
- **Record Count:** 10-20 records for manual review
- **Data Quality:** Mix of clean and problematic data
- **Business Logic:** Realistic business scenarios

### Version Control
- All test files stored in `backend/sample_data/`
- Documentation updated with each new file
- Change log maintained for test modifications
- Backup copies maintained for critical test scenarios

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Configuration Generation Failures
- **Symptom:** AI fails to generate configuration
- **Causes:** Ambiguous prompts, unsupported features, system timeouts
- **Solutions:** Simplify prompts, check feature availability, retry with smaller scope

### Poor Match Results
- **Symptom:** Low match rates or incorrect matches
- **Causes:** Wrong tolerance values, missing data cleaning, incorrect column mapping
- **Solutions:** Adjust tolerances, add extraction rules, verify column names

### Performance Issues
- **Symptom:** Slow processing or timeouts
- **Causes:** Large datasets, complex rules, insufficient resources
- **Solutions:** Batch processing, simplify rules, increase system resources

### Data Quality Problems
- **Symptom:** Unexpected results or processing errors
- **Causes:** Invalid data formats, missing values, encoding issues
- **Solutions:** Data validation, preprocessing, format standardization

This comprehensive testing suite ensures thorough validation of all reconciliation system features and provides a solid foundation for quality assurance testing.
